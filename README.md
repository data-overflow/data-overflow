### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year student with a geek towards computer science from an early age. I've worked on video games and random projects I find interesting, right from the age of 14.

Skills include 
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C++, C#
- **Backend**: Flask, FastAPI, Django
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS, Svelte, React, Tailwind 
- **Game Development**: Unity3D, Godot Engine, aseprite, famitracker, AR/VR
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, keras, Transformers
- **App Development**: React Native

Apart from the above technical skills, I'm also passionate about learning behavioral psychology and understanding why people behave the way they do.

I believe advancing technology and scientific research is the way forward to progress humanity. And I'm working to do my part in adding value to the ecosystem.
